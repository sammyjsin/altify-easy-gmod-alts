# Altify - Easily Alt On GMOD

If you have ever tried using alt accounts on gmod, you might know that some servers have addons that can detect if an alt account is being used via previous gmod files.
# This is a simple python script which deletes 3 essential within the gmod directory that servers use to track you:

/garrysmod/data 

/garrysmod/cl.db

/garrysmod/cfg/client.vdf

Deleting these 3 files will guarentee you cannot be detected via your garrys mod files
However, servers do use **IP BASED ALT DETECTION** , so make you you USE A NEW IP WHEN JOINING SERVER ON ALT

***How to use:***

***1) open run.bat***


***2) press enter to start deleting these files***


***3) once the program finishes, you can now just re open garrys mod! (USE A NEW IP FOR BEST SUCCESS)***
